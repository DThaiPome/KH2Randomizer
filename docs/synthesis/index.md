# Synthesis

This is a general guide to how randomized synthesis works in the generator. 

## How it Works

There are 30 "recipes" in the game, some you get from the synth shop directly for "Free Development" and some you have to find mid game in chests. For randomized synthesis all 30 of those recipes are modified to be "Free Development" and unlock very simply:
- First 15 recipes unlocked after finding 3 unique synth materials
- Second 15 recipes unlocked after finding 6 unique synth materials

At that point, you have access to all 30 recipes in Free Development, and can synthesize all items. The recipes for each item are randomized each seed, and can be in these ranges:
- 1-3 Synthesis items required
- 1-3 of each item required

So each recipe may take between 1 and 9 total items to complete. If you synthesize enough things, you can unlock access to using energy items, which can cut the cost of recipes in "half" meaning max is a total of 6 items. 

## Synthesis Items Required

Not all synth items are considered for recipes. Some items are not guaranteed to be placed in seeds, i.e. Orichalcum+, or seed settings may not have any synthesis items in the pool. For this reason, the list of synthesis is reduced to these items:
- Blazing 
- Frost
- Lightning
- Lucid
- Power
- Dark
- Dense
- Twilight
- Bright
- Energy

All of these categories of shards, stones, gems, and crystals can make up a recipe.
