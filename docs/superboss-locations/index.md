# Superboss Locations

Since the Garden of Assemblage is repurposed as a world hub, the Data Organization XIII fights are moved to alternate
locations. Along with this, some of the Absent Silhouette (AS) portals are moved to give each of the 13 main worlds one
of the Organization members as a superboss.

The superboss portals/doors will only appear once the appropriate story content has been cleared. For superbosses that
have both Absent Silhouettes and Data fights, once the Absent Silhouette version is defeated, entering the portal again
will initiate the Data fight.
